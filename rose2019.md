- # 2nd International Workshop on Robotics Software Engineering (RoSE'19) 
  - Co-located with [ICSE 2019](https://conf.researchr.org/home/icse-2019/) 
  - in Montréal, Canada 
  - between May 25 and May 31, 2019

  ## Theme & Goals

  Robotics is one of the most challenging domains for software engineering. Deploying even simple applications requires integrating solutions from experts of various domains, including navigation, path planning, manipulation, localization, human-robot interaction, etc. Integration of modules contributed by respective domain experts is one of the key challenges in engineering software-centric systems, yet only one of the cross-cutting software concerns crucial to robotics. As robots often operate in dynamic, partially observable environments additional challenges include adaptability, robustness, safety, and security.

  The goal of RoSE 2019 is to bring together researchers from participating domains with practitioners to identify new frontiers in robotics software engineering, discuss challenges raised by real-world applications, and transfer latest insights from research to industry.
  RoSE 2019 will solicit contributions from both academic and industrial participants, thus fostering active synergy between the two communities.

  ## Topics of Interest

  RoSE 2019 seeks contributions addressing, but not limited to, the following
  topics related to robotics software engineering:
  - Analysis of challenges in robotic software engineering
  - Architectures that lead to reusable robotic software
  - Challenges for defining and integrating domain-specific languages for the design of robotic systems
  - Continuous integration and deployment in robotics
  - Identification and analysis of design principles promoting quality of service (e.g., performance, energy efficiency) 
  - Engineering the collaboration of multiple (heterogeneous) robots
  - Machine learning for safety-critical robotic systems
  - Metrics to measure non-functional properties (e.g., robustness, availability, etc.) and their application in robotic software
  - Best practices in engineering robotic software
  - Variability, modularity, and reusability in robotic software
  - Validation and verification of robotic software
  - Processes and tools supporting the engineering and development of robotic systems
  - State-of-the-art research projects, innovative ideas, and field-based studies in robotic software engineering
  - Lessons learned in the engineering and deployment of large-scale, real-world integrated robot software

  ## Submission Guidelines 

  Prospective participants are invited to submit
  - research papers presenting novel contributions on advancing software engineering in robotics (max. 8 pages);
  - challenge showcase papers describing robotics challenges considered insufficiently addressed from an industry perspective (max. 6 pages);
  - lessons learned papers describing lessons learned in the collaboration between the two communities of software engineering and robotics (max. 6 pages);
  - vision papers on the future of software engineering in robotics (max. 4 pages);
  - tool and project papers on software engineering in robotics (max. 4 pages).

  Workshop papers must follow the [ICSE 2019 Format and Submission Guideline()/https://2019.icse-conferences.org/track/icse-2019-Technical-Papers#Call-for-Papers), but will use a *single blind* submission process. All submitted papers will be reviewed on the basis of technical quality, relevance, significance, and clarity by the program committee. All workshop papers should be submitted electronically in PDF format through the [EasyChair workshop website](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=rose2019). Accepted papers will become part of the workshop proceedings.

  ## Important Dates
