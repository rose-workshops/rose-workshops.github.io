## Finished Projects

### Green Tactics for Robotics Software
- Mission: From autonomous vehicles, to healthcare, and even in outer space, robots are part of our daily life. Energy is a critical factor for robotic systems, especially for mobile robots where energy is a finite resource (e.g., surveillance autonomous rovers). However, despite the advances in electronics and mechanics, one of the main barriers in robotics is software, since it is becoming massively large, complex, and difficult to measure.
The project will break this barrier by allowing roboticists to design energy-efficient robotics software via experimentally-validated green tactics. Green tactics will emerge by mining millions of lines of code of real- world robotics software. 
This research is partially supported by the Dutch Research Council (NWO) through the OCENW.XS2.038 grant.
- Duration: 2020 - 2021

### [Collaborative Embedded Systems (CrESt)](https://crest.in.tum.de/)
- Mission: The CrESt project investigates which modeling concepts, software languages, development methods, and tools are necessary to efficiently engineer futureâ€™s collaborative embedded systems including smart factories, automated cars, and mobile robots.
- Duration: 2017 - 2020

### Intelligent Service Robotics in Human Environments (iserveU)
- Mission: Investigate the feasibility of pervasive model-driven software engineering for complex service robotics applications in the domain of robotics transport applications in human environments.
- Duration: 2013 - 2016
