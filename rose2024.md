# 6th International Workshop on Robotics Software Engineering (RoSE'24)

- planned in co-location with [ICSE 2024](https://conf.researchr.org/home/icse-2024)
- planned as in-person event in Lisbon, Portugal
- April, 2024

## Theme & Goals
Robotics is one of the most challenging domains for software engineering. Deploying even simple applications requires integrating solutions from several domain experts, including navigation, path planning, manipulation, localization, human-robot interaction, \emph{etc}. Integration of modules provided by the respective domain experts is one of the key challenges in engineering software-centric systems, yet only one of the cross-cutting software concerns that are crucial to robotics. As robots often operate in dynamic, partially observable, and populated environments, additional challenges include adaptability, robustness, safety, and security. 

RoSE aims to bring together researchers and practitioners to identify new frontiers in software engineering for robotics, discuss challenges arising from real-world applications, and transfer the latest insights from research to industry.

## Topics of Interest

RoSE 2024 seeks contributions addressing, but not limited to, the following
topics related to robotics software engineering:
- Analysis of challenges in robotic software engineering
- Best practices in engineering robotic software
- Continuous integration and deployment in robotics
- Domain-specific languages and tools for the development of robotic software
- Empirical studies of robotics software and software tools, including its usability
- Engineering (heterogeneous) multi-robot systems.
- Identification and analysis of design principles promoting quality of service (e.g., performance, energy efficiency) 
- Lessons learned in the engineering and deployment of large-scale,
real-world integrated robot software
- Machine learning applied to robotic software
- Metrics measuring non-functional properties (e.g., robustness, availability, etc.) and their application to robotic software
- Mining software repositories of robotic systems
- Model-Driven Engineering methods and techniques applied to robotic software 
- Processes and tools supporting the engineering and development of robotic systems
- Software architecture of robotic systems
- State-of-the-art research projects, innovative ideas, and field-based studies in robotic software engineering
- Static and dynamic analysis of robotic software
- Usability studies of robotics software and tools
- Variability, modularity, and reusability in robotic software
- Validation and verification of robotic software

## Keynotes

We are planning to offer 1-2 invited keynotes.

Details will be published in the next months.


## Workshop Program

Workshop program will be published in the next months.

## Submission Guidelines

Prospective participants are invited to submit
- research papers presenting novel contributions on advancing software engineering in robotics (max. 8 pages);
- challenge showcase papers describing robotics challenges considered insufficiently addressed from an industry perspective (max. 6 pages);
- lessons learned papers describing lessons learned in the collaboration between the two communities of software engineering and robotics (max. 6 pages);
- vision papers on the future of software engineering in robotics (max. 4 pages);
- tool and project papers on software engineering in robotics (max. 4 pages).

Workshop papers must follow the ICSE 2024 formatting instructions, but will use a *single blind* submission process. All submitted papers will be reviewed on the basis of technical quality, relevance, significance, and clarity by the program committee. All workshop papers should be submitted electronically in PDF format through the EasyChair workshop website (Link will be published in the next months). Accepted papers will become part of the workshop proceedings.

The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM or IEEE Digital Libraries. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of ICSE 2024. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. Purchases of additional pages in the proceedings is not allowed.

## Important Dates

Will be published in the next months.
