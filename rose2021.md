# 3rd International Workshop on Robotics Software Engineering (RoSE'21)  

- Co-located with [ICSE 2021](https://conf.researchr.org/home/icse-2021) 
- Virtual
- June 2, 2021

## Theme & Goals
Increasingly, challenging domains employ robotic applications. Yet, Robotics still is one of the most challenging domains for software engineering. Deploying robotics applications requires integrating solutions from experts of various domains, including navigation, path planning, manipulation, localization, human-robot interaction, etc. Integration of modules contributed by respective domain experts is one of the key challenges in engineering software-centric systems, yet only one of the cross-cutting software concerns crucial to robotics. As robots often operate in dynamic, partially observable environments additional challenges include adaptability, robustness, safety, and security.

The goal of RoSE 2021 is to bring together researchers from participating domains with practitioners to identify new frontiers in robotics software engineering, discuss challenges raised by real-world applications, and transfer latest insights from research to industry. RoSE 2021 will solicit contributions from both academic and industrial participants, thus fostering active synergy between the two communities.


## Topics of Interest

RoSE 2021 seeks contributions addressing, but not limited to, the following
topics related to robotics software engineering:
- Analysis of challenges in robotic software engineering
- Architectures that lead to reusable robotic software
- Challenges for defining and integrating domain-specific languages for the design of robotic systems
- Continuous integration and deployment in robotics
- Identification and analysis of design principles promoting quality of service (e.g., performance, energy efficiency) 
- Engineering the collaboration of multiple (heterogeneous) robots
- Machine learning for safety-critical robotic systems
- Metrics to measure non-functional properties (e.g., robustness, availability, etc.) and their application in robotic software
- Best practices in engineering robotic software
- Variability, modularity, and reusability in robotic software
- Validation and verification of robotic software
- Processes and tools supporting the engineering and development of robotic systems
- State-of-the-art research projects, innovative ideas, and field-based studies in robotic software engineering
- Lessons learned in the engineering and deployment of large-scale, real-world integrated robot

**Software engineering for autonomous logistics robots** - Autonomous robots are more and more deployed in human environments, logistics, collaborative manufacturing applications, agriculture, or last-mile delivery tasks. These environments are characterized by dynamic changes, uncertainty from sensor readings and actuator movements, and disturbances by humans and other agents. That is, there are plenty of situations in which a robot needs to autonomously decide what to do in order to successfully accomplish its tasks. Traditional methods for programming robots often cannot provide this autonomy because they are lacking perception and decision-making capabilities. We believe that new, behavior-based programming methods are required to enable robots to robustly adapt and properly react to such unforeseen situations. However, when developing, deploying and operating products that exhibit highly autonomous behavior, new challenges arise: For guaranteeing a certain level of behavioural quality, novel testing and QA structures need to consider the complexity and non-determinism in the system. When operating a fleet of autonomous robots, the role of a robot manufacturer shifts from shipping products towards operating a distributed system of embodied computers connected to the Internet – which creates a number of opportunities, but also challenges to address.

**Challenges in transforming a 20 years old embedded robot controller software design to a modern modular design and using agile development practices** - The current generation of ABB robot controllers contains an embedded software, RobotWare, that saw first light already in 1994 with the S4 robot controller. Since then RobotWare has been continuously developed, refactored and refurbished to comply with the demands of the modern factory floors of today as well as the collaborative robot applications (Cobot) and flexible production facilities of the future. In the presentation the modular and agile approach to achieve this will be presented as well as the challenges that have been addressed and are foreseen.
