# 8th International Workshop on Robotics Software Engineering (RoSE'26)

- co-located with [ICRA 2026](https://2026.ieee-icra.org)
- in-person event in Vienna, Austria
- June 2026 (to be updated)

## Theme & Goals
Robotics is one of the most challenging domains for software engineering. Deploying even simple applications requires integrating solutions from several domain experts, including navigation, path planning, manipulation, localization, human-robot interaction, etc. Integration of modules provided by the respective domain experts is one of the key challenges in engineering software-centric systems, yet only one of the cross-cutting software concerns that are crucial to robotics. As robots often operate in dynamic, partially observable, and populated environments, additional challenges include adaptability, robustness, safety, and security.

RoSE aims to bring together researchers and practitioners to identify new frontiers in software engineering for robotics, discuss challenges arising from real-world applications, and transfer the latest insights from research to industry.

## Topics of Interest

RoSE 2026 seeks contributions addressing, but not limited to, the following
topics related to robotics software engineering:
- AI agents in the context of robotic software systems
- AI-enhanced development of robotics systems
- Analysis of challenges in robotic software engineering
- Best practices in engineering robotic software
- Continuous integration and deployment in robotics
- Domain-specific languages and tools for the development of robotic software
- Empirical studies of robotics software and software tools, including its usability
- Engineering (heterogeneous) multi-robot systems.
- Identification and analysis of design principles promoting quality of service (e.g., performance, energy efficiency)
- Lessons learned in the engineering and deployment of large-scale, real-world integrated robot software
- Machine learning applied to robotic software
- Metrics measuring non-functional properties (e.g., robustness, availability, etc.) and their application to robotic software
- Mining software repositories of robotic systems
- Model-Driven Engineering methods and techniques applied to robotic software
- Processes and tools supporting the engineering and development of robotic systems
- Software architecture of robotic systems
- State-of-the-art research projects, innovative ideas, and field-based studies in robotic software engineering
- Static and dynamic analysis of robotic software
- Usability studies of robotics software and tools
- Variability, modularity, and reusability in robotic software
- Validation and verification of robotic software
